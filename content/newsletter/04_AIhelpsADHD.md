Here are three links worth your time.

1. [AI for ADHD: How to Make ChatGPT Work for You](https://www.additudemag.com/chatgpt-ai-adhd-executive-function-support/)

This one's an oldie but a goodie.  Carole Fleck gives several quick ideas for how to use ChatGPT (and other Large Language Models) to offload tasks that are necessary to do, but typically the target of procrastination because they're so boring.

2. [How Generative AI Can Help with ADHD](https://www.addrc.org/how-generative-ai-can-help-with-adhd/)

This article, by Harold Robert Meyer, offers several AI-powered tips for various subject areas, like "creativity enhancement".  My opinion - watch out using AI for emotional regulation, but it's great for brainstorming and getting the creative juices flowing.

3. [How AI Helps ADHD Brains Work Smarter, Not Harder](https://www.beyondbooksmart.com/executive-functioning-strategies-blog/how-ai-helps-adhd-brains-work-smarter-not-harder)

Hannah Choi shows the reader how she, personally, uses Generative AI to streamline her daily workflow.  She does a great service to others by defending and encouraging use of these systems, especially for people with ADHD or other issues with focus.

I have confidence in you.  Now get back to work.
