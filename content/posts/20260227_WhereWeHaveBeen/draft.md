It's been a couple months since I published anything on here.  This one is me saying, I'm back.

My plan goes like this.

## The Web Log

I'm not going to push for 1000-1500 word self-help guides anymore.  Instead, I'm going back to the roots of the blog.

I'll shoot for 250-500 words instead, and talk about what I've been up to.  Things I've tried, things I'm working on, failures I'm trying to learn from, and other subjects that end in prepositions.

For example, I spent winter vacation in Stowe, Vermont, working on a product to sell to small hedge funds.  It's a report that compares annual SEC filings from companies to their prior-year filings, to identify any new or deprecated risks.

I'm still working on it, and kind of shipped a version of one to a hedge fund guy.  He never responded, and I put the kybosh on the project.

Why?

Because I'm committing to a different strategy now.  Ship first, build second.  I should have ham-fisted a report with my own eyeballs and fingers first, before trying to build a computer system to do it.  Then, ship that and see if there's any interest at all.

If there's no interest, why waste the time banging out code!?

## Mailing list

Besides maintaining an exciting log of my weekly foibles and follies, I'll send out a weekly email with my latest thoughts to you lucky subscribers.  So, put down your, drink.  Enter your email address.  And prepare to be drawn to the edge of progress at least once a week.

Thanks for reading.  See you next week!
