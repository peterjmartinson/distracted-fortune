Once upon a time, I fancied myself a weather man.  I had my own weekly segment called "[The LPAC Weather Report](LINK)".  In that video segment, I would comment on several topics I thought were connected - traditional weather, earthquakes, solar activity, cosmic rays, volcanoes, general astronomy.  Most of my days back then were focused on finding material to report, especially coincidences between various phenomena.

I began to experience almost a spiritual connection with the world around me, like I was in direct communication with nature.

For example, in August 2011 I did [an episode on earthquake forecasting and solar flares](LINK).  While composing the script, I suddenly heard something like a large garbage truck outside the office.  The thing was so loud and rumbly that the building shook a little bit.  But then it struck me - I jumped up and ran outside to find the parking lot empty.  We'd just been hit by a real earthquake, in northern Virginia!

How did the World know what I was working on!?

Needless to say, my script for the upcoming episode got a lot more spicy after that.

Those days are long gone, but recently I experienced a yearning for that childlike, immediate, intimate connection I'd felt back then.

A few weeks ago, I picked up a book called "[The Artist's Way](LINK)" by Julia Cameron.  This was the original source for the concept of [Morning Pages](LINK), about which I've written in the past, but I'd never actually read the book.

Her description of how to rekindle creativity has been a bang-on reflection of what I felt back in the Weather Man days.  That description has led me to a much more clear understanding of what I felt, and allowed me to knit together some other things I've learned along the way.

This article is about that!
